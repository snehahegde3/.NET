Oh your sweet despisition 
and my wild eyed gaze 
we're singing in the car
getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves falling into pieces
I can picture it, after all this time

And I know its long gone
and the magics not here no more 
You might be ok but i'm not fine at allllllooooooolllllllllll

So here we are again..in the middle of the night
we danced around the kitchen
in the refrigerator light
down the stairs
you were there
you remember it all toooo welllll!
in the middle of the night
we danced around the kitchen
in the refrigerator light
down the stairs
you were there
you remember it all toooo welllll!
ye thats it.
in the middle of the night
we danced around the kitchen
in the refrigerator light
down the stairs
you were there
you remember it all toooo welllll!
ye thats it.
in the middle of the night
we danced around the kitchen
in the refrigerator light
down the stairs
you were there
you remember it all toooo welllll!
ye thats it.
in the middle of the night
we danced around the kitchen
in the refrigerator light
down the stairs
you were there
you remember it all toooo welllll!
ye thats it.

we danced around the kitchen
in the refrigerator light
down the stairs
you were there
