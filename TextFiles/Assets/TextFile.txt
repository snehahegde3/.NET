Oh your sweet despisition 
and my wild eyed gaze 
we're singing in the car
getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves falling into pieces
I can picture it, after all this time

And I know its long gone
and the magics not here no more 
You might be ok but i'm not fine at allllllooooooolllllllllll

So here we are again..
